# ReadMe Generator

## Description

This tool creates a README file for projects. It uses inquirer to take inputs from the command line and creates a nicely looking readme with a table of contents.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
